# Background
Late in December 2019, the [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen) (WHO) China Country Office obtained information about a severe pneumonia of an unknown cause, detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. This later turned out to be the **novel coronavirus disease** (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by **severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2** (SARS-CoV-2) of the corona virus family. The disease causes respiratory illness characterised by primary [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) like cough, fever, and in more acute cases, difficulty in breathing. **WHO** later [declared covid-19 as a Pandemic](https://time.com/5791661/who-coronavirus-pandemic-declaration/) because of its fast rate of spread across the Globe with over [5.69 Million confirmed cases and over 355,000 deaths](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) as of May 28, 2020. The African continent started confirming its first cases in late January and mid-February of 2020 in some countries. The disease has since spread across all the 54 Africa countries with over [124,000 confirmed cases and over 3,600 deaths](https://africanarguments.org/2020/04/07/coronavirus-in-africa-tracker-how-many-cases-and-where-latest/) as of May 28, 2020. 

# The Dataset
The [covid_19_africa.csv](https://github.com/ju-ok/Covid-19-Africa.git) dataset contains daily level information about the Covid-19 cases in Africa.
It is a time series data and hence the number of cases on any given day is cumulative.I extracted the data from the [covid_19_data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset#covid_19_data.csv) which was made available on kaggle. The R script that I used to prepare this dataset is also available on [my Github repository](https://github.com/ju-ok/Covid-19-Africa.git). The original datasets can be found on [John Hopkins University Github repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) for covid_19. 

## Field description
- ObservationDate: YY/MM/DD
- Country: name of African country
- Region: Region of the African country
- Confirmed: the number of cOVID-19 confirmed cases
- Deaths:  the number of deaths from COVID-19
- Recovered: the number of recovered cases
- Active: the number of people still infected with COVID-19

## Task
Visualizations of Africaâ€™s COVID-19 cases.

# COVID-19 in Africa
## A summary of COVID-19 cases in Africa since 27th of January, 2020
Note that the lastest number of cases are those reported by end of the previous day.
```{r covid-19 Africa}

## Number of African countries with confirmed cases
```{r confirmed africa}

```
All the 54 African countries recognized by the UN and WHO have confirmed cases of COVID-19.

## Cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Africa
**Note: all plots with legends can be activated or deactivated by clicking on the legend.**
```{r cases in africa}

               new_deaths = Deaths - lag(Deaths, default = first(Deaths))) %>%

## Case Fatality Rate(%) and Recovery Rate(%) from COVID-19 in Africa
The [case fatality rate](https://www.britannica.com/science/case-fatality-rate) and recovery rate are dependant on accurate reporting of COVID-19 cases. The limited testing capacities of some African countries implies that these values may be inexact.
```{r CFR and RR}
# computing the rates
rates <- cases %>%
  mutate(case_fatality = (Deaths / Confirmed) * 100,
         recovery_rate = (Recovered / Confirmed) * 100,
         CFR = round(case_fatality, 2),
         RR = round(recovery_rate, 2))

# specifying the colors
rates_color <- c("CFR" = "red", "RR" = "lightgreen")

# plotting
rates %>% 
  gather(CFR, RR, key = "cases", value = "number") %>%
  hchart("line", hcaes(x = ObservationDate, y = number, group = cases),
         color = rates_color) %>%
  hc_xAxis(title = list(text = "Date")) %>%
  hc_yAxis(title = list(text = "Percent(%)")) %>%
  hc_tooltip(crosshairs = TRUE, sort = TRUE, table = TRUE) %>%
  hc_title(text = "Changes in the Case Fatality Rate(CFR) and Recovery Rate(RR) in Africa") %>%
  hc_chart(borderColor = "grey",
                 borderWidth = 1) %>%
  hc_add_theme(hc_theme_google())
```
