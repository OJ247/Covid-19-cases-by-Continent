## Background
Late in December 2019, the [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen) (WHO) China Country Office obtained information about a severe pneumonia of an unknown cause, detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. This later turned out to be the **novel coronavirus disease** (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by **severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2** (SARS-CoV-2) of the corona virus family. The disease causes respiratory illness characterised by primary [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) like cough, fever, and in more acute cases, difficulty in breathing. **WHO** later [declared covid-19 as a Pandemic](https://time.com/5791661/who-coronavirus-pandemic-declaration/) because of its fast rate of spread across the Globe with over [1.85 Million confirmed cases and over 114,000 deaths](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) as of April 13, 2020. The African continent confirmed its first cases in Mid February 2020 in some countries. The disease has since spread across 52 of the 54 Africa countries with over [13,900 confirmed cases and over 780 deaths](https://africanarguments.org/2020/04/07/coronavirus-in-africa-tracker-how-many-cases-and-where-latest/) as of April 13, 2020. 

## The Dataset
The [covid_19_africa.csv](https://github.com/ju-ok/Covid-19-Africa.git) dataset contains daily level information about the Covid-19 cases in Africa.
It is a time series data and hence the number of cases on any given day is cumulative.I extracted the data from the [covid_19_data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset#covid_19_data.csv) which was made available on kaggle. The R script that I used to prepare this dataset is also available on [my Github repository](https://github.com/ju-ok/Covid-19-Africa.git). The original datasets can be found on [John Hopkins University Github repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) for covid_19. 

### Field description
- ObservationDate: YY/MM/DD
- Country: name of African country
- Confirmed: the number of covid-19 confirmed cases
- Deaths:  the number of deaths from covid-19
- Recovered: the number of recovered cases

## Task
- Visualizations of Africaâ€™s covid-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases by country. 

Define a general figure size for all plots

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=10, fig.height=12) 
```

## Data processing
Loading the required packages and setting a general theme for all the plots.

```r
suppressMessages(library(tidyverse))
```

```
## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 3.6.3
```

```r
suppressMessages(library(lubridate))
suppressMessages(library(DT))
```

```
## Warning: package 'DT' was built under R version 3.6.3
```

```r
theme_set(theme_classic())
```

Importing the dataset

```r
covid_africa <- read_csv("covid_19_africa.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   ObservationDate = col_date(format = ""),
##   Country = col_character(),
##   Confirmed = col_double(),
##   Deaths = col_double(),
##   Recovered = col_double()
## )
```

Converting the classes of Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered columns to class integer.

```r
covid_africa <- covid_africa %>%
        
        mutate(Confirmed = as.integer(Confirmed), 
               Deaths = as.integer(Deaths),
               Recovered = as.integer(Recovered))
datatable(covid_africa)
```
